# SkilStak Pro Project Boilerplate

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.*

***Read carefully if you are in Pro because you can lose your invite
immediately if you fail to complete the project plan requirements on
schedule.***

***The biggest guideline of all is to create something worth
presenting. Remember, you are competing to keep your spot in the
Pro program.*** The more impressive your project the more likely
you will receive another Pro invite. Like the workplace,  SkilStak
Pro program is competitive program. Those with the best project
history and proposals will be given the invites. This has nothing
to do with aptitude. You can be the smartest person in the school
and if you do not complete your project deliverables, including
this project plan, you're out of Pro, immediately.

*Use this repo as a guideline for the minimum required for your Pro
project plan. You can fork it, but creating your own from scratch is
preferred.*

*Every invited Pro student must create a semester project plan repo
and complete the [Overview](#overview) and [Objectives](#objectives)
sections the by the second week of class or lose their invite
immediately* 

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Enhancement issue on
two different Pro projects by the third week of class or lose their
Pro invite immediately.*

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Question issue on two
different Pro projects three weeks before the end of the course or
become immediately ineligible for further Pro invites.*

*The quality of all comments made on others projects will be taken
into consideration for further Pro invites. Silly or extraneous
comments will not be considered comments resulting in an immediate
loss of the invite.*



Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos
or even an organization to contain the actual source code. The idea
is that the projects created in Pro could live on their own without
being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*

***Remember:*** *if you fail to submit a sufficient project completion
report in your plan you will not be invited back to Pro*
