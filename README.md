# YOUR PROJECT TITLE

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.*

***Read carefully if you are in Pro because you can lose your invite
immediately if you fail to complete the project plan requirements on
schedule.***

*Use this repo as a guideline for the minimum required documentation
for your Pro project plan. You can just fork it and change your copy
or make your own from scratch*

*Name your repo `pro-project-winter-2016` so everyone can find it.
You are welcome to delete the repo after the course ends if you
like (assuming you have properly created another project repo, or
have in past Pro classes).*

***Create something worth presenting, even your project is a game,
take this plan seriously.  Remember, you are competing to keep your
spot in the Pro program.*** The better your project the more likely
you will receive another Pro invite.

SkilStak Pro Winter 2016

## Overview

*Describe the general idea of your project in detail. About
a paragraph. Complete this section by the second week or lose your Pro
invite.*


## Objectives

*Here is where you write your goals, mostly what you want to get
out of the project. Start them with verbs if it helps ( Learn Go
HTML template language) and not external (i.e. I want to sell 20
apps).*

* Change these objectives to project plan objectives
* Delete the comments from this project plan
* Keep my Pro invite by completing all project deliverables

## Reference Links

*Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos or even an
organization to contain the actual source code. Link to it here.
The idea is that the projects created in Pro could live on their
own without being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Enhancement issue on
two different Pro projects by the third week of class or lose their
Pro invite immediately.*

*The quality of all comments made on others projects will be taken
into consideration for further Pro invites. Silly or extraneous
comments will not be considered comments resulting in an immediate
loss of the invite.*
