# SkilStak Pro Project Documentation - Winter 2016

Congratulations! You made it through the first official SkilStak
Pro course. It has been amazing watching your projects and the
format of the course take shape. One of the things that we started
(but did not finish up) was this idea of a Project Documentation
repo. The concept was a bit nebulous to some, so going forward we
will always have you fork the *SkilStak Pro Project Documentation*
repo containing the schedule, deadlines, and expectations for that
specific semester.

Next (Summer 2016) semester will have a full repo from the start. In
fact, one of the [deadlines](schedule.md) for the remaining weeks of
this semester is to review it completely.

This year, however, the documentation requirement will be less. 

Please immediately read the [schedule](schedule.md) for the remaining
weeks of Winter 2016.

Thanks for the great work you have done this semester, for yourselves
and for SkilStak.

Sincerely,
Mr. Rob
