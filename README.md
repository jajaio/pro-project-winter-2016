# SkilStak Pro Project Boilerplate

*Use this repo as a guideline for a the minimum required for your Pro
project plan. Pro students are required to review and open comments as
issues on two other projects besides their own. The quality of their
comments will be considered in Pro invite selections each semester.*

*Keep in mind that this is NOT the project itself, but the plan for
the project. Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos
or even an organization to contain the actual source code. The idea
is that the projects created in Pro could live on their own without
being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*

***Remember:*** *if you fail to submit a sufficient project completion
report in your plan you will not be invited back to Pro*
