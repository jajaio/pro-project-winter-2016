# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Winter 2016


[**AlphaQuest**](https://github.com/jajaio/alphaquest), is an old fashioned text based adventure game. In AlphaQuest, you fight monsters for money, so you can upgrade your fighter. Once you are strong enough, you can fight the evil dragon and beat the game. I built the whole game from the ground up, including things such as a battle engine, a store with in game money, and being able to save and load your game.

## Lessons Learned

AlphaQuest isn't the most organized thing in the world. I designed the game as I went, and learned new code as I made it.
if I were to re-write it, I would spend a lot more time planning out what I'm going to do beforehand and develop all at once.
It saves a lot of time because I woudn't have to go back and tweak so much. Also just a bit more polish.

## Next Steps

AlphaQuest is finished, and I don't plan on doing much more with it. But I will carry it's lessons on with me. I now know much more about multi-file programming, object oriented programming, and just basic programming knowlage. I am carrying this on with my next RPG: King's Army.
